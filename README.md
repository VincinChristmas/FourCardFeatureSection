## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I gained more experience using flexbox in this project. I learned that it was better to group some cards together. I originally didn't have the cards grouped. I still want to know if I could have used flex, basis, shrink, or grow in this project. I think I applied flex-wrap correctly


### Continued development

I want to make better layouts using flex-box and grid
